# Java Text Adventure Game
A standalone GUI based Java text-based adventure game

## Technical Info
By incorporating multithreading synchronization and thread suspension, the game aims to enhance immersion by offering features such as delays, colored text, formatting options (bold and italics), inventory management, and the ability to clear the console through code, which regular IDEs do not support. The game also utilises a two-dimensional array location map that automatically adjusted dialog and user options based on the player's surroundings. This provided a dynamic experience where the player's choices have a significant impact on the game.

## Story
You are a merchant from distant lands who suddenly finds yourself waking up after being robbed and beaten. Through the course of the game, you uncover the identity of your thief and embark on a journey to reclaim your stolen goods. Explore the world, battle against foes, and ultimately regain what is rightfully yours.
